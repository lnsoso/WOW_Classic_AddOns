# MyChatAlert

## 2.5.1.1

- Bug fix - tweak number delimiter localization to avoid a hard-coded space in the hope of fixing [Github issue #36](https://github.com/brodyreeves/MyChatAlert/issues/36)

## 2.5.1

- Bug fix - minimap icon wasn't updating when enable was toggled through config panel, now it does
- Bug fix - icon being registered multiple times on certain loads

## 2.5.0.1

- Getting parallel deployment working

## 2.5.0

- Dynamic minimap icon for enabled/disabled alert status
- Update README for new settings menu
- Now deployed to classic and retail

## 2.4.9

- Cleaned up options frame to make it less cluttered and easier to use
  - Options are now split into tabs, rather than one long list
- Better method used for the alert frame's close-on-escape-press handling

## 2.4.8.2

- Bug fix - disabling alerts was broken, now it's fixed and working properly

## 2.4.8

- `${channel}` is now a replacement option for printed alerts, inheriting the message color

## 2.4.7

- `MyChatAlert Globals` is replacing the `MyChatAlert Global Keywords` channel, and allows for global filter words as well
  - existing global keywords will be transferred over to prevent data loss
- Bug fix: Names with special characters can be ignored now
  - Trade-off: Invalid names can be ignored as well now, they don't cause issues, just won't ignore anything; might write a name validation check at some point, but that's fairly low priority
- README updated to be much more comprehensive

## 2.4.6.2

- Bug fix: All keywords registered to a channel should be checked again

## 2.4.6

#### New Features

- Loot channel is now functional and can be added for alerts
  - This works just as the prexisting channels and alerts do, with one difference: the loot channel will not check against keywords in the `Global Keywords` channel
  - I did this because I don't expect there to be overlap between what the global keywords are watching for, and what keywords will be used for loot alerts; if this is something that people want to be changed, it can be
- System channel is now functional and can be added for alerts
  - Same notes as the loot channel

#### Side note

- Did a lot of refactoring and I'm not sure if I broke existing saved variable setups. I don't believe I did as throughout my testing I didn't have any issues that required cleaning them up, but if I did then the fix is as simple as opening up the saved variable file (`World of Warcraft\_classic_\WTF\Account\ACCOUNT\Server\Character\SavedVariables\MyChatAlert.lua`) and altering the entries
  - I mostly refactored the filters/ignored authors/keywords so they should be the only possible sources of issues
  - If you notice something not behaving correctly (not deleting or deleting the incorrect entry) then check to make sure the above areas contain lists that look like `"text", -- [1] \\ "text", -- [2]`, where `\\` represents a newline
  - Weird behaviour is probably stemming from a case where one of these tables is sparse (no `[1]` or `[2]` entries, but a `[3]` entry), so changing the numbers to get it back in `[1]...[2]...[3]` form should fix it.
  - Alternatively, if you're not concerned with saving your stuff, you can just delete the file
  - Afterwards, also be sure to delete the second file in that same directory named `MyChatAlert.lua.bak`
  - Apologies if you have to deal any issues regarding saved variables, it's my hope that there aren't any

#### Example of an ignoredAuthor subtable in the saved variables

```lua
ignoredAuthors = {
  "name1", -- [1]
  "name2", -- [2]
  "name3", -- [3]
}
```

## 2.4.5

- New Feature: Option for class coloring on authors
- Keywords will now be colored in the printed message alerts
  - I noticed some strange coloring behavior when testing this, but I think I got it all fixed. If you notice something behaving weird try to grab a screenshot and let me know ([Github issues](https://github.com/brodyreeves/MyChatAlert/issues) are probably best for this, over curseforge comments, so that it's all grouped together in one post)
  - Messages in the alert frame will not be colored, personally I think it looks better uncolored, is easier to read, and I noticed a lot of weird coloring stuff happening in the frame so it's overall easier. However, some coloring options for the alert frame will probably be coming, given the available time and not an overwhelming amount of issues
- Performance changes + code cleanup

## 2.4.4.3

- Another bug fix, sanity check when checking global keywords
- Also caught potential bug when manually entering a channel name
- Also caught bug with unregistering events when deleting channels

## 2.4.3

- New feature: Time-based duplication filter
  - If the same person sends the same alert-triggering message within `X` seconds and the alert is still in-frame, don't trigger another alert for that message ([discussion over scope of this feature](https://github.com/brodyreeves/MyChatAlert/issues/27))
- New feature: Section for global keywords
  - These keywords will trigger alerts in any channels that you've added
- New feature: Choose where printed alerts will be output to
- New feature: Keywords now support operators:
  - `-` for terms to suppress alerts
  - `+` for additional terms to match
  - ex: `lf+dps-brd` will alert for a message containing `lf`, `dps`, without `brd`
  - ex: in this example, "lf2m dps brd farm" wouldn't trigger an alert, but "lf2m dps hogger farm" would
- New feature: Disable in instance
  - With this option selected, alerts will be toggled off while you are inside an instanced zone (determined via [IsInInstance](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_IsInInstance))

- New feature: Customize the printed alert messages
  - Color customization coming soon

    - Existing channels and keywords should be transferred into the new version
  - New feature, add filtering words to prevent triggering alertsw
- Author names in the alerts are now clickable (thanks to GH user tg123)

  - Because of this, the alert frame now displays the channel as well
  - Loot is currently unavailable, until I can look into this and test it
  - System is currently unavailable, until I look into the global strings that Blizzard uses to deliver these messages
