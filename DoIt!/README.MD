DoIt!
===

You can do anything allowed with DoIt! DoIt makes addon design simplier by providing a modular framework and reducing coding time. It also disconnects the idea that 
events have to be delivered though a frame, rather than just being handled by a function (basically one frame to rule them all).

Folder Structure
* Classy - This folder contains primary data types, and the instancing model for classes
* Core - This folder works directly with the WoW API
* Source - This folder is start-up and initialization for the entire framework

TODO
* Enable (and fix) the checks in Textures.lus for distinguishing between classic and retail
* Make moving windows cooler.. Saving location and choossing a specific window under the cursor from a dialog list
* Finish all the basic Classy classes.

Module Ideas
* Spindle an easy way to manage the layout of circle-icons around the mini-map.
* Managing advertisments, like "wtb port", "wts that"
